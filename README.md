# Hand_Sanitizer_Clorox_Wipe_Detector
Short description: This model detects Purell hand sanitizer and Clorox wipes using Tensorflow Custom Object API with Python

## ***Urgent:*** Seeking a position as a software engineer in the Deep Learning/Computer Vision field. 

## Please contact me at kjzehnder3@gmail.com for additional information if you are impressed by this project and feel that I could add value to your company. Thanks in advance.

***Note: Images and annotation files are included in this repository if you want to use them and train your own model ([click to view images and XML annotation files](SANITIZER/images))*** 

Use this ***EXCELLENT*** tutorial series if you want to learn how to build your own custom object detectors using Tensorflow Object Detection API: https://pythonprogramming.net/introduction-use-tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial/

If you are interested in using code directly from this repository please keep in mind that certain files in the "models" folder are too large to upload onto github. Secondly, the Tensorflow Object Detection API only works for me when I use tensorflow==1.13.2 (pip install --upgrade tensorflow==1.13.2) and the models version that I used can be found here: https://github.com/tensorflow/models/archive/v1.13.0.zip
